# Improv Wi-Fi Demo

This project demonstrates the use of <a href="https://www.improv-wifi.com/">Improv WiFi</a> via Serial communication. By clicking on the `Flash Firmware` button, the firmware of a simple webserver present in this repo will be installed in the ESP32 and the configuration to connect to the WiFi will be started. In case of the firmware is already present, you can change the WiFi settings without having to upload the firmware again.

Open the [Web Flash](https://jnthas.github.io/improv-wifi-demo/) site and click in `Flash Firmware` to install a SimpleWebServer, during the installation or after that you will be able to configure your Wi-fi network.
